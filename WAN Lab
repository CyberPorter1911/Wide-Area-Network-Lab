Assessing and Securing Systems on a Wide Area Network (WAN) 

## Overview
The Objective in this lab was to use Nmap OS Scan to discover vulnerabilities on an already compromised system.  Then harden the system and reduce the attack surface of the network asset

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Decoy IP address 
**Description:** At the TargetNMAP command prompt execute tcpdump - r phillip_capture_s2, then
At the vWorkstation command prompt execute the Nmap command to detect the operating system of the TargetVulnerable01 machine with increased output verbosity
